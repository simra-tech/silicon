# Load-servo corner matrix — C148 (800 ps/bit) and C149 (400 ps/bit)

Public-experiment record, 2026-08-06 evening — 2026-08-07 morning. In simulation only
(IHP SG13G2 corner libs, ngspice). Nothing here is a signoff or a tape-out claim.

## The circuit change (C148)

Common-mode feedback moved to the **loads**: the diode PMOS gates (XM3/XM4, 16.0u) are servoed so
the cml_out_p/cml_out_n average tracks VCMREF = 0.75 V (absolute source — a testbench idealization;
see Open items). XMTAIL fixed at 2.5u, so common mode and tail current are independent. Under the
previous tail-servo (C146), cm wandered ~100 mV across corners; under C148 it holds 0.765–0.776 V
(11 mV spread).

## The measurement standard (eye_decode.py)

Decode by **sweeping the sampling offset** (0.05-bit steps, bounded above by the simulated window)
and report the contiguous zero-error spans — never an error count at a single phase. A
phase-quantized decoder (integer pattern shift + fixed 0.5-bit phase) can only sample at offsets
k+0.5 and turned corner-dependent chain latency into phantom errors: the "5/64 and 12–13/64
failures" first reported for the C148 27 C corners were the sampling instant sitting on the eye
edge. Controls that keep the standard honest:

- **Reference**: comparator differential (xcomp.c_p − c_n, 0 V slice) must decode 0/64 in the same
  raw, else the run is void.
- **Floor**: the 64-bit TX has 31 ones / 33 zeros, so a stuck pin scores 33 (high) or 31 (low).
- **Closed-eye control**: C146's failing corners have **no** zero-error offset at any position —
  the standard does not rescue genuinely broken circuits.
- **Point count**: verify raw npoints against the deck's expected count before reading anything
  (ngspice exits 0 after aborted transients).
- **Sweep bound**: latency in bits doubles when the bit halves; a minimum at the sweep edge means
  the sweep is too short (C149's first report clipped the −40 minimum this way: 20/64 at a 0–3
  sweep, truly 8/64 at offset 3.35).

## C148 verified results, 800 ps/bit, 64-bit PRBS-7 window

| corner | cm (V) | zero-error span (bits past 10 ns settle) | width |
|---|---|---|---|
| TT-TYP-125 | 0.7760 | 1.30–2.15 | ~720 ps |
| SS-TYP-27  | 0.7673 | 1.55–2.45 | ~720 ps |
| SS-TYP-125 | 0.7716 | 1.50–2.35 | ~680 ps |
| SS-WCS-27  | 0.7673 | 1.60–2.45 | ~680 ps |
| SS-WCS-125 | 0.7715 | 1.50–2.35 | ~680 ps |
| SS-WCS-N40 | 0.7651 | 1.70–2.55 | ~680 ps |

**Cross-corner intersection 1.70–2.15 bits (360 ps): one fixed sampling instant decodes all six
corners at 0/64.** The −40 corner had been dead (stuck-pin floor) in every prior configuration.
Threshold sensitivity: at a fixed in-window instant, all six corners decode 0/64 for any slice
threshold 0.10–1.10 V.

## C149 verified results, 400 ps/bit, same netlist

No corner has any zero-error offset (sweep 0–11 bits). Minima: TT-TYP-125 2/64 @2.60,
SS-TYP-125 5/64 @2.90, SS-WCS-125 6/64 @2.95, SS-TYP-27 7/64 @3.05, SS-WCS-27 7/64 @3.10,
SS-WCS-N40 8/64 @3.35. The rig holds a 0.95-bit clean span at every corner, so the comparator
front end is clean at 2.5 GS/s; the ceiling is the sense-amp/latch stage (state-change time,
~100 ps evaluate needed).

**Rate of record: 1.25 GS/s across the full six-corner matrix. 2.5 GS/s fails at every corner
with this architecture.**

## Prior-claim audit (C145, tail-servo era, same standard)

27 C corners at 1600 ps/bit: no zero-error offset (minima 11 and 9). SS-WCS-N40: stuck-pin floor
at 1600 and 3200 ps. SS-TYP-27 at 3200 ps: 1/64 at best offset. SS-WCS-27 at 3200 ps: 1440 ps
clean span. All pre-C148 rate-ladder conclusions stand.

## Open items

- VCMREF is an ideal 0.75 V source; a real part needs a VDD-ratioed or bandgap reference. C150
  (full 127-bit PRBS period, VDD 1.08/1.32/1.20 V, six corners) is running as this is written and
  will be appended once independently verified.
- Schematic-level only: no layout parasitics, no mismatch, no noise analysis yet.
- Path to 2.5 GS/s: interleaved sense amps (alternate bits) — proposed, not designed.
